To give you the best advice, I need a little more information.\n\nCould you tell me:\n\n1.  **How high is your blood pressure typically?** (e.g., \"around 140/90\", or \"I don't know the exact numbers\")\n2.  **Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or any other conditions?**\n3.  **Do you have any other health conditions, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or kidney problems?**\n4.  **What is your current lifestyle like?** (e.g., diet, exercise habits, smoking, alcohol consumption)\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide some general recommendations to help manage your hypertension.\n"
